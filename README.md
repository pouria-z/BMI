# BMI Calculator

BMI Calculator


Body Mass Index is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. This value applies to the body of every adult.
With this application you will be able to easily calculate your BMI and find out if your weight is appropriate for your
height or not. In other words, are you underweight or overweight, or are you normal and in perfect health?
By entering your weight and height in this application, you will see the normal weight range based on your height.
