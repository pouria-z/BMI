  "about1": "Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person."
      " The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m\², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. The BMI may be determined using a table or chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and height"
      " using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may use other units of measurement"
      " (converted to metric units for the calculation). The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly"
      " categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight"
      " (under 18.5 kg/m\²), normal weight (18.5 to 25), overweight (25 to 30), and obese (over 30)."
      " BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-causes mortality,"
      " with the risk increasing with distance from the 20–25 range.\n",

  "about3": "\nAdolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician and sociologist,"
      " devised the basis of the BMI between 1830 and 1850 as he developed what he called social physics."
      " The modern term \"body mass index\" (BMI) for the ratio of human body weight to squared height was"
      " coined in a paper published in the July 1972 edition of the Journal of Chronic Diseases by Ancel Keys"
      " and others. In this paper, Keys argued that what he termed the BMI was \"...if not fully satisfactory,"
      " at least as good as any other relative weight index as an indicator of relative obesity\".",
